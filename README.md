### Hello, I'm Santatra! ðŸ‘‹

I study Signals and Systems Physics at Antananarivo University, Madagascar. ðŸ˜„

### What I am working on:
I'm pretty busy with college these days :confused: :books: but my latest project which I'm trying to perfect is an RFID based attendance system which you can find [here](https://github.com/HarimbolaSantatra/rfid-attendance-system).
