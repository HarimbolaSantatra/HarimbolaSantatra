### Hello, I'm Santatra! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software/computer enthusiast living in Madagascar.
I'm studying Computer Science at Antananarivo University, Madagascar. ðŸ˜„

### What I am learning :
I'm currently learning ASP.NET by writing a .NET Inventory App. The tech stack includes:
- ASP.NET MVC as back-end
- Bootstrap & JQuery as front-end
- MySQL server as database
- Different Nuget package (Mailkit/Mimekit for email, iText7 for PDF handling, etc...)

I'm using pure MySQL Connector instead of Entity Framework to connect the application to a MySQL database, for performance and learning purposes  :sweat_smile: .

### What I'm working :
I'm also trying to include some data science and/or machnel learning project inside this repository. I'm currently working on an :point_right: a Reinforcement Learning game using Pygame. :point_left:

Thanks for the visit.
